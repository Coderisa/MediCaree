# MediCare

MediCare is a web-based healthcare platform that aims to provide a centralized system for managing healthcare services across multiple hospitals. The platform has different modules for different types of users, such as patients, doctors, hospital administrators, lab workers, and pharmacists. The platform allows users to perform various tasks related to their healthcare needs, such as accessing information, booking appointments, purchasing medicines, paying for tests, and communicating with each other. The platform also allows users to access and share their health records with other authorized users, such as doctors or pharmacists. This way, the platform helps users to manage their healthcare needs more easily and conveniently, while also reducing the workload and costs for healthcare providers.
